	<center><h3>HBC Fire</h3></center>
	<center><p class="lead">B2005</p></center>
	<center><p>The Fire have learned a tremendous amount over the years.  They play a very nice possession style of soccer.  They finished as division champions completing an undefeated season for the S2016 campaign.  In 2018 they ended up LI Cup Finalists and 2019 LI Cup 3rd round. They have had great success in their past seasons since the age group change.  We practice 2x per week and play several leagues and tournaments.  This team plays outstanding soccer for their age and is built around a core of players who have been a part of our developmental program for the past 5 years.  Please note that we focus on teaching the boys proper techniques, skills, and understanding of the game that will be necessary to develop into a high level team.  </p></center>

	<center><p class="lead">B2007</p></center>
	<center><p>This team has shown tremendous growth since it's inception.  The boys are learning how to play within a system and are beginning to understand the "job" that each position on the field has in the overall success of the team.  Our practice sessions are designed to work on individual skill sets while introducing team defending and possession concepts to the players.  We still do not focus on "winning", we worry about the development of each individual player.  The boys are given more responsibility and are encouraged to make mistakes without worrying about the results of the games.  Practice is 2x per week.    </p></center>

	<center><p class="lead">B2008</p></center>
	<center><p>This team transitioned very successfullyy from "intramural" to travel and has shown great improvement over the course of the past two seasons.  Our practice sessions for this age group are designed to introduce the children and the parents to a different mind set as we focus first on our defensive shape which will help them as they continue to develop.  Our team is not built around a handful of players but rather is a total team concept where each position is expected to contribute to the success of the team.  We work on individual skill sets while introducing team defending and possession concepts to the players.  We practice 2x per week.</p></center>

	<center><p class="lead">B2010</p></center>
	<center><p>This team currently plays in SM in LIJSL.  Our program has been developing teams in this age group for over 15 years and has a proven track record in working with children in this group.  Our practice session are designed to introduce the children and parents to a new level in their soccer development as we work on individual skill sets while introducing team defending and possesion concepts to the players.  We will not focus on "winning" but rather the development of each individual player.  Down the road, winning will come from understanding how to play the game.  We practice 2x per week.</p></center>
